# Receta Gatimi

### Description:
<p>This is an Albanian version of the EasyPlate app that I have built before on Android Studio. This app is built using React Native.
Receta Gatimi provides the user with the ability to search recipes by choosing from several available ingredients.The user will choose 
the ingredients shown which are available to him/her and then the app will provide the user with the most suitable results. The application
is mostly designed for students who most probably lack experience in cooking. Thus, Receta Gatimiâ€™s main function is to save time.
